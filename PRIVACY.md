## Introduction

Thank you for using AguapaneIA! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

AguapaneIA does not collect any personal identifiable information (PII) from users without consent. The extension processes text selections and actions locally on your device to provide the functionalities described below:

- **Text Improvement**: Your selected text is enhanced locally or via remote AI services. No personal data is stored or shared without your explicit consent.
- **Translation Services**: AguapaneIA uses external translation APIs to provide real-time translation between English and Spanish. Any text sent for translation is not stored beyond the necessary time to return results.
- **AI Assistant**: Your interactions with the AI Assistant are processed solely to provide the service, and no personal data is retained by the extension or shared with third parties.

## Permissions

To provide its features, AguapaneIA requests certain permissions:

- **activeTab**: To detect text selections and enable interaction with web content.
- **Storage**: To save your preferences and settings locally on your device.
- **Notifications**: To display real-time notifications regarding completed tasks.
- **Scripting**: To enable interactions with the page content, such as showing the floating AI button.

None of these permissions are used to access or store your personal data. All data processed by the extension remains on your device or is transmitted only for the purpose of providing the requested service.

## Third-Party Services

AguapaneIA uses third-party AI services for text enhancement and translation. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and AguapaneIA ensures that no unnecessary personal data is shared with these services.

- Opt-out of any data processing by uninstalling the extension at any time.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
